dataNames = {
	ped = "skinID",
	vehicle = "vehicleID",

}

dataNames.player = dataNames.ped -- must be the same

-- support pickups with custom object models
dataNames.pickup = dataNames.object -- must be the same

-- useful for getting a vehicle's base model to fetch its original handling, etc
baseDataName = "baseID"

-- If you are 100% sure that the mods in mod_list.lua are valid, you can disable initial checks
-- for faster startup time

-- Newmodels will try to start these resources (identified by their names) after newmodels has started,
-- as well as stop them when newmodels is stopped
-- Usually these are resources that use newmodels and you want them to start only after newmodels,
-- and they can be stopped when newmodels stops
